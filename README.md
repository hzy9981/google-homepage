## Clone of the Google Home/Search Results Page

No functionality has been coded in, this is just a html/css mockup.

Slight changes to the UI have been made, especially on the Search Results page.
Just some enhancements for personal taste.

1. Fixed alignment of website info popup button
2. Respaced search refine tools (web/videos/shopping/etc)
3. Added some breathing room on the results page nav (page numbers)

All images, etc are owned by Google. This is just for educational/practice purposes.
